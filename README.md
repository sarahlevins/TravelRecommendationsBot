# Travel Recommendations ChatBot

A simple contextual chatbot built with Rasa NLU and Rasa Core

You can interact with and train the travel recommendations bot [here](https://travelrecommendationbot.herokuapp.com/) 

This bot is a passion project and still in development. Any assistance, advice or recommendations would be welcomed

## Usage
I run and develop both versions of this bot locally in [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```
docker-compose up
```

run the docker-compose as is and you can chat with the bot at the 
[localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook](http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook) (using [postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/))

You can also download [Rasa Open Source](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/user-guide/installation/) using pip
